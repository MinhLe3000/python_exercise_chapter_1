# Chapter 1 - Python Programming Language Exercises

This repository contains exercises for **Chapter 1** of the Python Programming Language course.

## Overview

These exercises are designed to help students practice fundamental Python programming concepts, particularly working with lists, built-in functions, and basic operations.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Calculate Sum of Elements
**Objective:** Given a list of numbers, calculate the sum of all elements in the list.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Lists in Python
- The `sum()` function
- Basic arithmetic operations

### Exercise 2: Calculate Statistics
**Objective:** Given a list of numbers, calculate the average, maximum, and minimum values of the elements in the list.

**Concepts Covered:**
- The `sum()` and `len()` functions
- The `max()` and `min()` functions
- List iteration and calculations
- Statistical measurements

### Exercise 3: Check Value Existence
**Objective:** Given a list and a value entered via the keyboard, determine whether the value exists in the list.

**Concepts Covered:**
- User input with `input()` function
- List membership testing using the `in` operator
- Conditional statements
